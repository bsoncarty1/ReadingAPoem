# ReadingAPoem

This is a program that will read a file name and a string from the command line. Next, the program will find the number of occurrences of the string in that file and count the number of empty lines too. 
I have attached poem.txt to this repository so that it can be used as an example. In order to run the program, open the command line, go to the location of the source code, type "make fileTest.c" and press enter. Once that is done, type "./fileTest poem.txt light" and press enter. The program will display to the user how many times the word "light" is found in the file and will also tell the user how many empty lines the text file has. If you want to search for a different word, replace the word light with the word you want to find. The program is not case-sensitive, so you can enter the word you are searching for any way that you would like.

I wanted to display this C language code here because this was the final assignment that I did in my C Programming class. It shows the level of C that I can currently code at, and I am proud of it because before taking this class I had no knowledge of how to use C.
